Because the traditional matching cost calculation algorithm is difficult to meet the accuracy requirements of complex tasks. In recent years, deep learning methods have made successful breakthroughs in image processing. Because of their superior performance in self-learning and feature information extraction, we aim to use deep learning algorithms to calculate high-precision initial matches cost in this project .
